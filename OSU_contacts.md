## Perspective

In my 5 years at Ohio State, I received my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering in 2022 and then my Masters of Science in 2023. During my studies I focused on robotics, AI, mechanical engineering, and computer science. 

In my last 2 years, I spent my freetime becoming a newbie real estate investor. You can read about [the challenges I faced](https://visualstudycode.com/making-floor-plans-my-crazy-college-rental/) if you want. 

During my masters, I held a teaching job in product design and graded and helped run lectures for Annie Abell. In the summer of 2023, I then held a job at the Risk and Reliability lab, aka the Nuclear research lab. Now I'm at Sherwin as a Robotics Engineer.
